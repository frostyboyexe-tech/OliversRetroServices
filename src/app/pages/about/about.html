    <h1>About Oliver</h1>
    
    <p>
      Hi! I'm Oliver! The founder of ORS (Oliver's Retro Services). 
      
      I've always been fascinated by electronics and how they work. Over the years, I've spent countless hours researching and learning about how technology works. 
      I enjoy figuring out how everything connects and works together.
    </p>

    <p>
      Programming and video games have also been a major passion of mine. 
      I’ve spent years creating my own games — including retro-style games 
      designed to run on real hardware. Working within the limitations of 
      these systems has taught me a lot about efficiency, optimization, 
      and how these consoles operate.
    </p>

    <p>
      Recently, I've become deeply interested in retro consoles and electrical engineering. So, I started ORS to fufill my passion and to help bring the passion to others.
      Working on retro consoles combines everything I love -- electronics, programming knowledge, video games, and hands-on problem solving.
    </p>

    <p>With Oliver's Retro Services I wish to share my passions with my local community by giving you a reliable, forward, and trustworthy service. </p>
